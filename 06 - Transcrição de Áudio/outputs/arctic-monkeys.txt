Well, now that mighty boom, I've seen your frown and it's like looking down the bottle of a gun.
And it goes off and I'll come all these words. Oh, that's a very pleasant side to you.
Aside, I much prefer swampers, laughs and jokes around. Remember cuddles in the kitchen? Yeah, forget
things up the ground. And it was up, up and away Ah, but it's rare to remember that on a day like today,
when you're all argumentative and you've got a face on. Without a money bone. Oh, I'm in trouble again.
I'm sorry, I thought as much, because you turned over there and pulling that silent disappointment,
says the one that I found. Barely. Can't we just laugh and joke alone? Remember cuddles in the kitchen?
Yeah, to get things off the ground. And it was up upon the way. Oh, but it's Ray Archer.
Remember that on a daylight today, when you're all argumentative. And you've got to face on.
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late, but I missed the train and then the traffic was a state and I can't be
asked to carry on in Mr Payne, that reoccurs. Or when you say I don't care about Castle to me, I clearly do.
Slap and joke around. Remember cuddles in the kitchen? Yeah, to get things off the ground.
And it was up a brand away. I'll put it straight up to remember that on a day like today when you're on
your own. Argumentative and you've got the face on.
